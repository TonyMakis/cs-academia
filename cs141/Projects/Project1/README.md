# Project 1: TwentyFour

This is the first project in the course; it is a simplified version of the game Twenty-Four, which prompts a user with a 4-digit number puzzle (sometimes called [wheels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_Game#24%C2%AE_Game), as the real game utilizes a card to show the digits in a circular formation).

> The user will need to enter 3 valid operators (*only these:* `+ - * /`) that when applied to the numbers in the puzzle, produce the number 24 when operating from left-to-right => **ignoring order of opertions!**
> e.g. Given `3 3 2 6` as a puzzle, one could say: `+ - *`, b/c:
>
> - `3 + 3 - 2 * 6 = 24` => **again, ignore oreder of ops.**

## Project Structure

This is a two-phase development; the first and second stages each have their own writeups, but Stage 2 does depend/utilize Stage 1, so it was programmed in order.

## Restrictions for this Project

We were *not* allowed to utilize _arrays_ for this project (originally). After some discussion, this requirement was modified to allow us statically defined arrays with size __no greater than 10 elements__ (Not allowed to allocate memory dynamically).

Any further, atomic requirements are described in the different Stages!
